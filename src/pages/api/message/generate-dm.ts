            Analyze this job description and curate a short and engaging Instagram DM for the job.
            The DM should:
            - Be concise, natural, and friendly
            - Use a conversational tone
            - Highlight skills matching the job requirements
            - Replace words in [] that fit the job
            - Only share a portfolio if the job is for graphic design, software development, or SEO (developer: https://saifanees.vercel.app, design: https://sayfanees.vercel.app)
            - Don't mention a portfolio if the job is for 3D modeling (excluding 3D websites), virtual assistant, writing, digital marketing, or any other niche
            - Avoid excessive formality
            
            This is the sample:
            
            "Hey [person's name or brand's name], I came across your post about [job/task mentioned] and wanted to reach out! I'm a [Web Developer/Designer/etc.] with experience in [relevant skill], and I'd love to help you with [the task]. Let me know if you're open to chattingâ€”would love to hear more about what you're looking for!"
            
            Format your response exactly as and nothing else:
            MESSAGE:
            [Instagram DM]
            
            Job Description:
            "${req.body.jobDescription}"`;

      model: modelEmailWriter,
